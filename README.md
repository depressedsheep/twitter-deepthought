# twitter-deepthought
Research Project for event detection and data analysis.
This is currently in development. To run main.py, you have to create a config file (config.py) with your own Twitter API, and boto keys.

##To-do List (tentative):
- LDA generation
- Graph display
- Integrating main analysis module with the other modules
